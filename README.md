# UFOs
In this project, we are employing JavaScript to create a very organized and reactive UFO sightings table. With HTML, CSS and bootstrap we are displaying a functional table that responds to a filltering button.

## Purpose of the Analysis
   * The main purpose of the whole analysis could be summarized as follows:
     - To use HTML, Javascript and bootstrap to display a browser with a UFO sighting table
     - To add a responsive filtering funtion that takes values and return a filtered table
     - To add attractive NASA image as a header and make our displaying web-page a professional looking

- As a drawback, the webpage does not have many javascript funtions that respond to more customer input (interaction)
- It is the most plain display of data and only one header image... how wonderful would it be if actual UFO images were included

## Result and Analysis
   - A javascript code was written that creates a table holding a data from data.js

   - An HTML script is also written on which the javascript object is going to display.
   - A NASA image was added to make our website attractive
   - An additional filtering functionality was added that can further digest our UFO sighting data

    ## Recommendations
        * Finally, we can recommend:
          - In future analysis, we recommend adding images of UFOs through out the webpage, that will make the webpage eye-catching
          - Adding an automated function that will update a new UFO sighting in to the data is a plus
